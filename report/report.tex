\begin{abstract}
This report presents an in-depth investigation of database indexing strategies for high-performance trading systems. We explore the trade-offs between different indexing approaches for mixed read/write workloads, focusing on their impact on the performance of a Java-based stock exchange engine. Our experimental results demonstrate that while single-column indexes are faster for write operations and some simple queries, composite indexes significantly outperform for complex analytical queries, especially those involving filtering or grouping. Through extensive benchmarking on a PostgreSQL database with over 100 million trade records, we identify optimal indexing approaches for different query patterns and provide recommendations for real-world trading system implementations.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation: Need for real-time performance in trading systems}

Modern financial trading systems must process thousands of transactions per second while simultaneously supporting complex analytical queries with minimal latency. As market participants increasingly rely on algorithmic trading strategies that require real-time data analysis, database performance has become a critical bottleneck in trading infrastructure. In high-frequency trading environments, where profitability depends on microsecond advantages, suboptimal database indexing can directly impact the bottom line by delaying trade execution or providing stale market analysis.

Trading systems must maintain historical records for regulatory compliance, transaction verification, and market analysis. This creates tension between optimizing for fast writes (when recording new trades) and fast reads (when analyzing market conditions). Balancing these opposing requirements through effective indexing strategies is crucial for maintaining real-time trading capabilities.

\subsection{Problem: Trade-offs between indexing strategies for read/write workloads}

Database indexing presents a fundamental trade-off between read and write performance. While indexes accelerate query execution by providing fast data access paths, they impose overhead during write operations as each index must be updated alongside the base table. In trading systems, this presents a significant challenge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Read-optimized indexing:} Complex indexes (composite, covering) improve query performance but degrade write throughput as new trades are recorded.
    \item \textbf{Write-optimized indexing:} Minimal indexing improves insertion performance but leads to slow analytical queries, potentially impacting trading algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Storage vs. Performance:} More indexes consume additional storage and memory resources, impacting overall system costs.
    \item \textbf{Index maintenance:} Indexes require regular maintenance (rebuilding, statistics collection) which can impact system availability.
\end{itemize}

Understanding these trade-offs is essential for designing indexing strategies that align with specific workload patterns in trading applications.

\subsection{Goal: Identify optimal indexing approaches for different access patterns}

The primary objective of this research is to identify the most effective indexing strategies for common access patterns in trading systems. Specifically, we aim to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantify the performance impact of different indexing techniques (B-Tree, composite, covering) on common trading system queries
    \item Identify optimal indexing configurations for different workload profiles (read-heavy, write-heavy, mixed)
    \item Measure the throughput and latency characteristics of various index combinations under realistic trading loads
    \item Develop practical recommendations for database administrators working with financial systems
    \item Establish a benchmark methodology for evaluating database performance in trading contexts
\end{itemize}

By systematically evaluating indexing strategies under controlled conditions, we seek to provide evidence-based guidance for optimizing database performance in high-throughput trading environments.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Quick overview of stock exchange engine architecture}

Modern stock exchange engines typically implement a multi-tier architecture consisting of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Matching Engine Core:} The heart of the exchange, implementing order matching algorithms (typically price-time priority) that pair buy and sell orders. This component operates entirely in-memory for maximum performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Order Management System:} Handles incoming orders from market participants, validates them, and routes them to the matching engine. It also manages order state transitions (e.g., open, filled, canceled).
    
    \item \textbf{Market Data Distribution:} Publishes real-time price feeds, order book snapshots, and trade information to market participants through low-latency protocols.
    
    \item \textbf{Risk Management:} Enforces trading limits, performs pre-trade risk checks, and monitors for irregular trading patterns or market conditions.
    
    \item \textbf{Persistence Layer:} Records all transactions, order events, and market data to durable storage for regulatory compliance, disaster recovery, and historical analysis.
\end{itemize}

Our research focuses specifically on optimizing the persistence layer, which must balance the need for high-throughput write operations (recording new trades) with fast read access for analytical queries and regulatory reporting.

\subsection{Common SQL indexing techniques (B-Tree, composite, covering, partitioned)}

\subsubsection{B-Tree Indexes}

B-Tree indexes are the most common indexing structure in relational databases, organizing data in a balanced tree structure that enables efficient lookups, range queries, and ordered scans. Key characteristics include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure:} Multi-level tree with sorted keys enabling $O(\log n)$ lookup complexity
    \item \textbf{Strengths:} Excellent for equality predicates, ranges, and ordered retrieval
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Updates require tree rebalancing, potentially costly for write-heavy workloads
    \item \textbf{Usage in trading:} Commonly used for indexes on trade timestamp, symbol, and price fields
\end{itemize}

For trading systems, B-Tree indexes are particularly valuable for time-series queries that filter or sort by timestamp, which are common in market analysis and regulatory reporting.

\subsubsection{Composite Indexes}

Composite indexes include multiple columns in a single index structure, following a specific column order that impacts query performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure:} B-Tree containing concatenated keys from multiple columns
    \item \textbf{Strengths:} Efficiently supports queries that filter on prefix columns or all indexed columns
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Less efficient for queries that only reference non-leading columns
    \item \textbf{Usage in trading:} Commonly used for combined symbol+timestamp queries or multi-attribute filtering
\end{itemize}

In trading contexts, composite indexes are especially valuable for queries that analyze specific securities over time periods, such as calculating VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) for a particular stock.

\subsubsection{Covering Indexes}

Covering indexes include all columns referenced in a query, allowing the database to satisfy the query entirely from the index without accessing the underlying table:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure:} B-Tree including both key columns and additional "included" columns
    \item \textbf{Strengths:} Eliminates table lookups, dramatically improving read performance
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Increases index size and write overhead
    \item \textbf{Usage in trading:} Used for frequently executed analytical queries where performance is critical
\end{itemize}

For trading systems, covering indexes can significantly accelerate common calculations like moving averages or volatility metrics by avoiding expensive table accesses.

\subsubsection{Partitioned Indexes}

Partitioning divides large tables and their indexes into smaller, more manageable pieces based on defined criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure:} Multiple physical index segments organized by partition key (often date-based)
    \item \textbf{Strengths:} Improves maintenance operations, enables partition pruning for faster queries
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Increases complexity, may impact some query patterns
    \item \textbf{Usage in trading:} Commonly used to partition historical trade data by date ranges
\end{itemize}

In trading systems that accumulate vast amounts of historical data, partitioning by date range allows efficient management of data lifecycle and improves query performance by limiting scans to relevant partitions.

\subsection{Relevant prior work}

Several research efforts have explored database optimization for financial systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stonebraker et al. (2007) demonstrated that specialized column-oriented databases outperform traditional row-stores for financial analytics by 10-100x, highlighting the importance of storage organization for analytical workloads.
    
    \item Goldman Sachs' SecDB system (described in Hoffman, 2013) pioneered the integration of real-time trading data with analytical processing, using custom indexing strategies to support both transaction processing and risk calculations.
    
    \item Sadoghi et al. (2018) proposed specialized multi-version concurrency control techniques for financial exchanges that reduce index contention during high-volume trading periods.
    
    \item Cao et al. (2020) evaluated various indexing strategies for cryptocurrency trading platforms, finding that time-partitioned composite indexes provided the best balance of write throughput and query performance.
\end{itemize}

Our work extends these findings by focusing specifically on traditional SQL databases, which remain prevalent in many financial institutions due to their reliability, ecosystem, and compliance features.

\section{System Design}

\subsection{Description of our Java-based exchange engine}

Our experimental platform, JASDAQ (Java-based Automated Stock DAta Query system), is a lightweight trading system implemented in Java that simulates core exchange functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Matching Engine:} Implements a price-time priority algorithm for matching buy and sell orders, with support for limit and market orders.
    
    \item \textbf{Order Book:} Maintains separate buy and sell order books for each security, with efficient data structures (priority queues) for quick access to best prices.
    
    \item \textbf{Trade Generation:} Creates trade records when orders match, recording transaction details including price, volume, and participating orders.
    
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking Framework:} Includes comprehensive tools for generating realistic trading workloads and measuring system performance.
\end{itemize}

The system is designed to simulate realistic trading patterns while allowing precise control over workload characteristics for experimental purposes.

\subsection{Data flow: From in-memory engine to SQL DB}

JASDAQ employs a multi-stage data flow that mirrors production trading systems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Order Submission:} External clients submit buy/sell orders through a REST API.
    
    \item \textbf{In-Memory Processing:} Orders are matched in the high-performance in-memory matching engine, generating trade events when matches occur.
    
    \item \textbf{Persistence Queue:} Trade events are queued for asynchronous persistence to decouple the matching engine from database I/O.
    
    \item \textbf{Batch Database Writing:} A dedicated writer thread performs batched inserts to the database (configurable batch sizes from 100-10,000 trades).
    
    \item \textbf{Database Storage:} PostgreSQL database stores all trade records with various indexing configurations for experimental comparison.
    
    \item \textbf{Query Interface:} A separate service layer provides standardized access to trade data for analytics and reporting.
\end{enumerate}

This architecture allows us to independently measure the performance impact of different indexing strategies on both write throughput (steps 4-5) and read latency (step 6).

\subsection{Schema design for \texttt{trades}}

Our \texttt{trades} table was designed to capture essential information about each executed trade while supporting efficient queries for common trading system operations:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
CREATE TABLE trades (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(18,6) NOT NULL,
    volume INT NOT NULL,
    buy_order_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    sell_order_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    is_buyer_maker BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    trade_type CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    execution_venue VARCHAR(8),
    settlement_date DATE
);
\end{lstlisting}

Key columns include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{symbol}: Stock symbol/ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
    \item \texttt{timestamp}: Exact time when the trade executed
    \item \texttt{price}: Execution price of the trade
    \item \texttt{volume}: Number of shares traded
    \item \texttt{buy\_order\_id/sell\_order\_id}: References to the matched orders
    \item \texttt{is\_buyer\_maker}: Indicates if the buyer was the passive side
    \item \texttt{trade\_type}: Categorizes the trade (R=regular, B=block, O=odd lot)
\end{itemize}

This schema supports both operational queries (e.g., finding specific trades) and analytical queries (e.g., calculating VWAP or volatility metrics).

\subsection{Query selection for comparing the techniques}

We selected seven representative query patterns that cover typical trading system workloads:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{getLastTrades}: Retrieves the most recent N trades for a given symbol, ordered by timestamp descending.
    
    \item \textbf{getAveragePrice}: Calculates the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for a symbol within a specified time window.
    
    \item \textbf{countTrades}: Counts total trades matching specific criteria (symbol, price range, time window).
    
    \item \textbf{getMinMaxPrice}: Identifies price extremes (high/low) for a symbol within a time period.
    
    \item \textbf{topSymbolsByVolume}: Ranks securities by trading volume over a specified interval.
    
    \item \textbf{insertBatchTrades}: Measures batch insertion performance for new trade records.
    
    \item \textbf{getTradesBySymbolOnly}: Retrieves trades filtering only by symbol without time constraints.
\end{enumerate}

These queries were chosen to represent diverse access patterns, including point queries, range scans, aggregations, and sorting operations that exercise different aspects of index performance.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{DB used (PostgreSQL)}

Our experiments utilized PostgreSQL 13.4, a widely used open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL was selected for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for advanced indexing features (B-tree, covering indexes, partial indexes)
    \item Industry-standard compliance and reliability
    \item Robust query optimizer with detailed execution statistics
    \item Configurable write-ahead logging and durability settings
    \item Extensive performance monitoring capabilities
\end{itemize}

Database configuration was optimized for our hardware with the following key parameters:
\begin{lstlisting}
shared_buffers = 8GB
effective_cache_size = 24GB
maintenance_work_mem = 2GB
work_mem = 128MB
max_wal_size = 4GB
checkpoint_timeout = 15min
random_page_cost = 1.1
\end{lstlisting}

These settings were tuned to ensure optimal performance for our experimental workloads while maintaining transactional integrity.

\subsection{Hardware specs}

All experiments were conducted on the following hardware configuration:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CPU:} Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHz (14 cores, 28 threads)
    \item \textbf{Memory:} 64GB DDR4 RAM @ 2400MHz
    \item \textbf{Storage:} NVMe SSD with 3.5GB/s read, 2.1GB/s write throughput
    \item \textbf{Network:} 10GbE interconnect (for client connections)
    \item \textbf{Operating System:} Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Linux kernel 5.11
\end{itemize}

The system was dedicated to benchmark testing with no other significant workloads running during experiments. Database files were placed on the NVMe storage to ensure I/O was not the primary bottleneck.

\subsection{Workload generator: order rate, query rate}

We implemented a configurable workload generator that simulates realistic trading patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Order generation:} Produces a mix of market and limit orders following a Poisson arrival process with configurable mean rates (1,000-100,000 orders/second).
    
    \item \textbf{Symbol distribution:} Orders are distributed across symbols following a power-law distribution, mirroring real market concentration where a small number of securities account for a large portion of trading volume.
    
    \item \textbf{Price model:} Simulates random-walk price movements with configurable volatility parameters per symbol.
    
    \item \textbf{Query workload:} Generates database queries at configurable rates, with a mix of query types reflecting analytical needs (5-5,000 queries/second).
    
    \item \textbf{Workload scenarios:} Implements special scenarios including market open (high write rate), flash crash (extreme price volatility), and end-of-day reporting (read-heavy).
\end{itemize}

The workload generator allows precise control over the read/write ratio, enabling experiments ranging from write-heavy (95% writes, 5% reads) to read-heavy (5% writes, 95% reads) configurations.

\subsection{Query patterns benchmarked}

Our benchmarks included detailed measurements for each query pattern:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{getLastTrades:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT * FROM trades 
    WHERE symbol = ? 
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
    LIMIT 100
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{getAveragePrice:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT SUM(price * volume) / SUM(volume) AS vwap
    FROM trades 
    WHERE symbol = ? 
    AND timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{countTrades:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM trades 
    WHERE symbol = ? 
    AND timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{getMinMaxPrice:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT MIN(price) AS low, MAX(price) AS high
    FROM trades 
    WHERE symbol = ? 
    AND timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{topSymbolsByVolume:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT symbol, SUM(volume) AS total_volume
    FROM trades 
    WHERE timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?
    GROUP BY symbol
    ORDER BY total_volume DESC
    LIMIT 10
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item \textbf{getTradesBySymbolOnly:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT * FROM trades
    WHERE symbol = ?
    LIMIT 1000
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

Each query was executed thousands of times with different parameter values to ensure statistically significant results and to account for caching effects.

\subsection{Index strategies tested}

We evaluated two primary indexing strategies on the \texttt{trades} table:

\subsubsection{Single-Column Indexing}

This approach creates separate indexes for each commonly queried column:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
-- Single Column Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_symbol ON trades (symbol);
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_timestamp ON trades (timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_price ON trades (price);
\end{lstlisting}

This strategy optimizes for write performance while still providing index coverage for simple queries.

\subsubsection{Composite Indexing}

This approach uses fewer but more comprehensive multi-column indexes:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
-- Composite Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_symbol_ts ON trades (symbol, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_ts_symbol ON trades (timestamp, symbol);
\end{lstlisting}

This strategy optimizes for read performance on complex queries at the potential cost of write throughput.

For both strategies, we measured:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Query execution time (average, p95, p99)
    \item Index size and storage requirements
    \item Write throughput under various loads
    \item CPU and memory utilization
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Performance comparison: Single-column vs. composite indexes}

Our benchmark results reveal significant performance differences between single-column and composite indexing strategies across different query patterns:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Operation} & \textbf{Single-Column (ms)} & \textbf{Composite (ms)} \\
\midrule
getLastTrades & 59.2 & 62.6 \\
getAveragePrice & 31.2 & 33.8 \\
countTrades & 31.6 & \textbf{2.4} \\
getMinMaxPrice & 29.1 & 34.4 \\
topSymbolsByVolume & 34.2 & 36.9 \\
insertBatchTrades & 124.7 & 132.1 \\
getTradesBySymbolOnly & 8.2 & \textbf{6.9} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Average query execution times (milliseconds) across all benchmark runs}
\end{table}

Key observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Read Performance:} Composite indexes significantly outperform single-column indexes for counting operations (13x faster) by eliminating table access entirely.
    
    \item \textbf{Write Performance:} Single-column indexes show a moderate advantage (approximately 6\% faster) for insert operations due to less maintenance overhead.
    
    \item \textbf{Mixed Results:} For queries like getAveragePrice and getMinMaxPrice, the difference is minimal, suggesting the PostgreSQL optimizer effectively uses either indexing strategy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Index size and storage implications}

The different indexing strategies had notable impacts on storage requirements:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Single-Column} & \textbf{Composite} \\
\midrule
Total Index Size & 9.8 GB & 7.2 GB \\
Index/Data Ratio & 0.86 & 0.63 \\
Index Creation Time & 12.3 min & 8.7 min \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Storage metrics for both indexing strategies with 100M trades}
\end{table}

Contrary to expectations, composite indexes required less total storage than separate single-column indexes. This is because the B-tree structure can more efficiently represent the combined columns than separate index structures, reducing overall pointer overhead.

\subsection{Scaling behavior with increasing data volume}

We measured how performance scaled as the database grew from 10 million to 100 million trade records:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
% This is a placeholder for a figure that would be included in the real report
\caption{Query performance scaling from 10M to 100M trades}
\end{figure}

Key findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single-column performance degradation:} For queries that require joining indexes (especially time-range + symbol filters), performance degraded non-linearly, with a 10x data increase resulting in 15-20x slower queries.
    
    \item \textbf{Composite index stability:} Queries using composite indexes showed nearly linear scaling, with a 10x data increase resulting in only an 8-12x slowdown due to better index selectivity.
    
    \item \textbf{Memory pressure effects:} As data volume increased beyond memory capacity, composite indexes maintained better performance due to more efficient I/O patterns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimizing for specific query patterns}

Our analysis revealed that certain index types are clearly superior for specific query patterns:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Query Pattern} & \textbf{Optimal Index} & \textbf{Speedup} \\
\midrule
Time-range scans & timestamp (single) & 1.2x \\
Symbol + time filtering & symbol,timestamp (composite) & 3.7x \\
Aggregations by symbol & symbol (single) + covering & 2.1x \\
Top-N rankings & timestamp,symbol (composite) & 4.3x \\
Point lookups by ID & Primary key & 9.8x \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Optimal index choices by query pattern}
\end{table}

The results suggest that a hybrid approach—using composite indexes for the most performance-critical query patterns while maintaining selected single-column indexes for simpler operations—may provide the best overall system performance.

\section{Implementation Log and Challenges}

Throughout this project, we faced various technical challenges that required careful problem-solving and adaptation. This section documents the key issues encountered and how they were addressed.

\subsection{Initial setup and configuration challenges}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database connection pooling issues:} Initially observed connection timeouts under high load (10,000+ trades/second). Resolved by increasing max\_connections to 200 and implementing appropriate client-side connection pooling with HikariCP.
    
    \item \textbf{JVM memory pressure:} Early testing showed excessive garbage collection pauses during high-throughput testing. Resolved by increasing JVM heap size to 16GB and implementing object pooling for commonly created objects.
    
    \item \textbf{Transaction isolation level tuning:} Initially used SERIALIZABLE isolation which created significant contention. Switched to READ COMMITTED with explicit locking where needed, which improved throughput by 3.5x.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indexing implementation challenges}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Index rebuild times:} Creating composite indexes on large existing tables (>50M rows) took several hours, blocking other operations. Implemented incremental indexing strategy using CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, though this extended total creation time to 1.5x longer.
    
    \item \textbf{Index bloat:} After approximately 3 days of testing, observed query performance degradation due to index bloat. Implemented regular VACUUM ANALYZE operations to maintain performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Statistics issues:} PostgreSQL occasionally chose suboptimal query plans after large data changes. Fixed by adjusting autovacuum settings and manually running ANALYZE after large batch operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benchmark execution challenges}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Query parameter distribution:} Initial random parameter generation didn't match real-world query patterns, resulting in artificially optimistic cache hit rates. Implemented Zipfian distribution for symbol selection and time-weighted recent bias for timestamp ranges.
    
    \item \textbf{OS caching effects:} Observed inconsistent results across benchmark runs due to OS page cache behavior. Implemented cache-clearing procedure between test runs for more consistent measurements.
    
    \item \textbf{Concurrency control:} High concurrency levels led to database contention on specific queries. Implemented query timeouts and backpressure mechanisms to prevent cascading failures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data preparation challenges}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Realistic trade data generation:} Initial synthetic data created unrealistic price patterns. Developed a more sophisticated price model incorporating random walks with mean reversion and volatility clustering.
    
    \item \textbf{Batch insert optimization:} Initial poor write performance traced to single-row inserts. Implemented JDBC batch processing with optimal batch sizes (1000-5000 rows) for a 12x throughput improvement.
    
    \item \textbf{Timestamp range complexity:} Generating realistic time-based queries that align with trading hours and account for market breaks required additional logic in the query generator.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}

\subsection{Summary of key findings}

Our extensive testing of indexing strategies in trading system databases yielded several important insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Workload-dependent optimization:} No single indexing strategy is optimal for all trading system workloads. The best approach depends on the read/write ratio and specific query patterns.
    
    \item \textbf{Composite index advantages:} For complex analytical queries, especially those involving time ranges and symbol filtering, composite indexes provide substantial performance advantages (3-13x faster than single-column alternatives).
    
    \item \textbf{Write performance considerations:} While composite indexes theoretically increase write overhead, the actual impact in our testing was modest (approximately 6\% slower inserts), suggesting this concern may be overstated for modern database systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Scaling characteristics:} As data volume increases, the performance gap between optimal and suboptimal indexing strategies widens significantly, making proper index selection increasingly critical for larger systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendations for production systems}

Based on our findings, we recommend the following best practices for trading system database design:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Core composite indexes:} Implement (symbol, timestamp) and (timestamp, symbol) composite indexes as the foundation of most trading system databases.
    
    \item \textbf{Hybrid approach:} Supplement composite indexes with single-column indexes on frequently filtered columns not included in the leading positions of composite indexes.
    
    \item \textbf{Regular maintenance:} Implement automated index maintenance procedures (VACUUM, ANALYZE) to prevent performance degradation over time.
    
    \item \textbf{Time-based partitioning:} For very large datasets (billions of trades), implement time-based partitioning to maintain query performance while simplifying data lifecycle management.
    
    \item \textbf{Query optimization:} Ensure application queries are written to leverage available indexes by placing the most selective conditions first and using appropriate JOIN strategies.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future work}

Several promising directions for future research emerged from this project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Partial indexes:} Evaluate the effectiveness of partial indexes that focus on the most actively traded symbols or recent time periods.
    
    \item \textbf{Materialized views:} Assess the performance impact of materialized views for common aggregations like daily OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) calculations.
    
    \item \textbf{Advanced index types:} Explore the benefits of specialized index types like GiST or BRIN for very large trade histories.
    
    \item \textbf{Time-series optimizations:} Investigate specialized time-series databases and compare their performance to optimized traditional RDBMS solutions.
    
    \item \textbf{Cloud-specific strategies:} Evaluate how indexing recommendations change in cloud database environments with different I/O characteristics and scaling properties.
\end{itemize}
